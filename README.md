# HideMyAssProxyScrapper

This is a proxy scrapper for https://www.hidemyass.com/ website that provides free list of proxies. It uses javascript for scrapping the proxies from the following URL : http://proxylist.hidemyass.com/ . This is a beta version and verified on 23/07/2016. If you find any bugs or need any improvements, please feel free to contact me. I would be more than happy to implement it.

How to use : 
1) Open http://proxylist.hidemyass.com/ in your browser (Currently tested on Google Chrome and Mozilla firefox)
2) Press F12 or open developer tools -> Go to console
3) Fire the javascript code from HideMyAssProxyScrapper.js
4) It will display an array of all the IP adresses with PORT on that page (i.e XX.XX.XX.XX:YYYY)
